# HPD-10.INS
Roland HPD-10 instrument definition file for Cakewalk


This is my attempt at constructing the .ins file.
It is currently populated with my favourite patches; I intend to add the other patches as and when needed.

With thanks to http://www.chromakinetics.com/handsonic/
especially Luiz Dias (footkeys) and Peter (gollob at inote.at)

## Random Information

AppData\Roaming\Cakewalk\SONAR Platinum\Master.ins

If pads are swapped (using the internal function) HPD-10 still appears to transmit the unswapped note numbers.

If HH, and foot switch, then HPD-10 will transmit 4 steps lower.
